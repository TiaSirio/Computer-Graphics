# Vulkan Labyrinth

This project is an implementation of a labyrinth using Vulkan. It was created as a way to explore the Vulkan graphics API and to showcase the power of real-time rendering in creating immersive environments.

## Features

- First-person view
- Real-time lighting
- User-controlled camera movement
- Integrated tutorial for controls
- Object-oriented style
- Logic to open door with keys and levers
- Progress at end game
- Height map to control movement
- Window resize
- Playable with controller

## Requirements

To run the application, you will need the following:

- A Vulkan-capable GPU (graphics card)
- Vulkan SDK (Software Development Kit)
- GLFW (a multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan)
- GLM (a C++ mathematics library for graphics software)

## Controls

The controls are explained in a tutorial inside the application.

## Credits

This project was developed by as a part of a computer graphics course at Politecnico di Milano.
